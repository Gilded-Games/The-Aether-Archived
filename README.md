This is a fork of Aether Legacy with the aim is to create an Aether mod that retains the original mod's faithfulness to vanilla Minecraft with more content and quality of life changes. So far, this vision has been carried out in the form of backporting content from Aether II, but various extra tweaks, features, and additions have been added as well.    

Changes made so far:
  - Added Aether II aerclouds (green, purple, storm). Additionally:
    * Textures edited to be monochrome so that they can be tinted, like Aether I aerclouds (including pink)
    * All bouncy aerclouds now make the bounce sound from Aether II
    * All bouncy aerclouds won't bounce if sneak is held, not just blue
    * Storm aerclouds now drip water below them
    * Pink aerclouds now generate by default
  - All mounts are controlled clientside like horses (no more laggy Moas!)
  - Added new grass types from Aether II (arctic, magnetic, irradiated)
  - Added tallgrass from Aether II (generates by default now)
  - Skyroot tools with silk touch will now drop double of the silk touched block, not just double of the normal drop
  - Changed Neptune and Phoenix armor textures to the Aether II: Genesis of the Void versions to make them unique
  - Water is now the Aether II color
  - New tree types from Genesis of the Void
    * Blue - normal, massive
    * Dark Blue - massive + branches
    * Purple - "fruit tree" but without the fruit, as crystal trees have fruit already
  - Added Aether Grass Paths (idea by üíé‚òÅBlade Foxfairy‚úéüéÆ#0429)
  - Added Ambrosium Lamps (idea and texture by üíé‚òÅBlade Foxfairy‚úéüéÆ#0429 on the Aether Discord)
  - Fixed bugs/improvements:
    * No more errors in console due to Sheepuff loot tables not having name fields
    * Fixed Valkyrie Queens from only checking the first inventory slot containing medals to see if you have enough
    * Made holystone, quicksoil, and Aether ores have more vanilla-standard hardness/resistance values
    * Aether grass, dirt, and quicksoil are now efficient with shovels

Things to do:
  - Bosses more gracefully support multiple players (tried this already but was having trouble)
  - New biomes from Aether II

## :package: Download the latest releases
### "Stable" builds
[![CurseForge downloads](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_255308_downloads.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-aether-mod)
[![CurseForge packs](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/packs/full_255308_in_packs.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-aether-mod)

We use Curseforge to publish **stable builds** of the Aether for Minecraft. You can download the latest stable builds from our [official page found here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-aether-mod) without signing up for an account, and even install the Aether for Minecraft using the [Twitch Launcher](https://www.curseforge.com/twitch-client) with built-in integration for Curseforge mods. We recommend using our stable Curseforge releases for most people.

### Bleeding edge builds
[![Jenkins build status](https://img.shields.io/jenkins/s/https/jenkins.gildedgames.com/job/The-Aether/job/1.12.2.svg?style=flat-square)](https://jenkins.gildedgames.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/The-Aether/activity)

If you're feeling a bit more adventurous (or a developer has suggested you to do so), we provide **bleeding edge builds** which are produced on [our official Jenkins instance](https://jenkins.gildedgames.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/The-Aether/activity). These builds are very frequently created by an automatic service and contain the latest available code without undergoing any form of quality control. We do not generally recommend users use these builds as they may contain serious issues and will not generally receive support.

## :bug: Report bugs or other issues
If you're running into bugs or other problems, feel free to open an issue on our [issue tracker](https://gitea.gildedgames.com/GildedGames/The-Aether/issues). When doing so, we ask that you provide the following information:

- The exact version of the Aether you are running, such as `1.12.2-1.5.1`, and the version of Forge you are using, such as `14.23.5.2847`. Please do not state "the latest stable release" or "latest Forge".
- If your issue is a bug or otherwise unexpected behavior, state what you expected to happen.
- If your issue is a crash, attach the latest client or server log and the complete crash report as a file.
- If your issue only occurs with other mods/plugins installed, list the exact mod/plugin versions installed.

Make sure to keep your issue's description clear and concise. Your issue's title should also be easy to digest, giving our developers and reporters a good idea of what's wrong without including too many details. Failure to follow any of the above may result in your issue being closed.
